\section{Timeline}\label{sec:timeline}

We want to roughly divide the project into four stages, each with specific goals and deadlines:

\textbf{Stage} & \textbf{Time} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Deliverables and Milestones}\\
\hline

Stage 1: Setup and Preparation
& Jan 16, 2026 - Feb 27, 2026
& First, we will set up a working environment, and put time into understanding the problem and plan for the project. We will also implement downstream models as well as a baseline compression framework to have a starting point for comparison.
&
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, nosep]
    \item Project plan document (13.02.)
    \item Two regression downstream models trained on Volvo data and public data (20.02.)
    \item Two classification downstream models trained on Volvo data and public data (27.02.)
    \item Baseline compression framework implementation (27.02.)
\end{itemize}
\\
\hline

Stage 2: Development
& Feb 28, 2026 - Mar 27, 2026
& Second, we will focus on developing the core components of the proposed compression approach leveraging tokenization. We will also start writing the theory chapters of the thesis and formulize a halftime report. 
&
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, nosep]
    \item Encoder component implementation (13.03.)
    \item Quantization/ Tokenization module implementation (13.03.)
    \item Decoder component implementation (13.03.)
    \item Completed theory chapters of the final thesis (20.03.)
    \item Halftime report (27.03.)
\end{itemize}
\\
\hline

Stage 3: Experiments
& Mar 28, 2026 - Apr 17, 2026
& Third, we will focus on evaluating the performance of the proposed compression method against the baseline model. 
&
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, nosep]
    \item Six compressed datasets, using two compression methods (08.04.)
    \item Evaluation results based on compression (08.04.)
    \item Trained downstream models (17.04.)
    \item Evaluation results based on downstream task performance (17.04.)
\end{itemize}
\\
\hline

Stage 4: Finalizing
& Apr 18, 2026 - May 15, 2026
& Finally, we will conduct an ablation study to understand the contribution of different components of the proposed method, and finalize the thesis document for a first draft.
&
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, nosep]
    \item Ablation study results (01.05.)
    \item Expremint, Results, Discussion chapter of the thesis (10.05.)
    \item Complete draft of the final thesis (15.05.)
\end{itemize}
