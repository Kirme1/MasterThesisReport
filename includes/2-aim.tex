\section{Aim}\label{sec:aim}

The aim of this project will be to investigate the use of neural compression techniques, specifically tokenization-based approaches, for compressing automotive time series data. The goal is to develop a compression framework that effectively balances the trade-off between compression ratio and utility for downstream machine learning (ML) tasks, such as predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.

The motivation behind using tokenization as a neural compression strategy for automotive time series data is to produce discrete latent representations that simplify the entropy modeling task within the compression pipeline. By constraining the data to a finite set of tokens, the complexity of modeling the underlying data distribution is reduced, enabling the use of lightweight entropy models that are computationally efficient. This is particularly advantageous in automotive applications where computational resources are limited, and real-time processing is often required.

The goal will be to design, implement and evaluate a tokenization-based neural compression framework tailored for time-series data. Evaluation will be conducted by comparing relevant parameters between the proposed framework and traditional compression methods.
